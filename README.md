# Cards Against Quarantine 2.0
Second version of Cards Against Quarantine, mocking the modern day classic [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) down to its Helvetica Nue, this time with JavaScript and JQuery. Inspired by missing family across the country during quarantine and not being able to find a virtual version of the game. Decided to solve the problem by making my own. [Originally created](https://github.com/brinkbrink/cards) with PHP.
****
Cards Against Quarantine 2.1 with the addition of Node.js and MongoDB coming soon!
